# Quantum Information Theory

## Classical mechanics

I am using the the book *The theoretical minimum : what you need to know to start doing physics* by 
Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky.

We are going to be using the SymPy [classical mechanics package](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/index.html) to solve some problems.

**Cellular automata**

Cellular automata are physically motivated models of computation. They are systems with a translationally invariant state-space
and a stroboscopic time-evolution.

*No slides/white board lectures*

**The principle of least action**

- additional materials: [Feynman lectures on the principle of least action](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_19.html)

**Symmetries and conservation laws**

**Hamiltonian mechanics and time-translation invariance**

**Phase space fluid and the Gibbs-Lioville theorem**

**Poisson brackets, angular momentum, and symmetries**

## Quantum mechanics

I cover quantum mechanics in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits, and quantum algorithms in the course *Quantum computing*. 

Here I want to explain the transition from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.

I am using the book *Quantum mechanics : the theoretical minimum* by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman.  I will also use other materials.
