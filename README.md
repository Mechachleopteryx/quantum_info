## Classical mechanics

I am using the the book *The theoretical minimum : what you need to know to start doing physics* by 
Leonard Susskind and George Hrabovsky to prepare most of the slides.

We are going to be using the SymPy [classical mechanics package](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/mechanics/index.html) to solve some problems.

**Cellular automata**

Cellular automata are physically motivated models of computation. They are systems with a translationally invariant state-space
and a stroboscopic time-evolution.

## Quantum mechanics

I am using the book *Quantum mechanics : the theoretical minimum* by Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman to prepare most of the slides.
